# Challenge #1, should you choose to accept...

In this directory there is a file named "textfile.md". It contains several hundred lines of text.

As a team, you must parse the content of that file and write a Ruby method that checks each line to determine if it is palindromic.

The lines will contain letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric symbols. Non-alphanumeric characters such as punctuation and quotation marks should not be taken into account, nor should the method check for case-sensitivity. Lines that contain no alphanumeric characters should not be counted towards the total.

For example:

"Madam, I'm Adam" is a palindrome.

BONUS: Write a recursive method to check for palindromes!

### Tips

Try to take a test-driven approach - having a spec file is necessary to pass the challenge.

Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of well-written tests, clean + readable code, and adherence to SOLID principles.

When your 15 minutes is up, push your solution to Github and Hipchat the repo link to the Codejamz room.
